# Panda CMS v0.8.0 - Automatic Migration Installation

## UI Improvements

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with form buttons missing background colors
  - The `button` method in the FormBuilder now properly applies action-specific styles
  - Fixed "Create Page" button on the new page form

### Accessibility Improvements

- Improved color contrast in the "Sky" theme
  - Changed the active/success color from #A6D381 to #459A59 (darker green)
  - This provides better contrast against white text, improving readability
  - Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast

### Changes

- Updated both the source CSS and compiled CSS files for theme colors
- Button styling is now consistent between the ButtonComponent and form buttons

## Theme Selection and Easier Updates

### New Features

- Added a "My Profile" page to change first name, last name and email address
- Added user theme preference selection on the profile page
  - Users can now choose between "default" and "sky" themes

### Developer Improvements

- Improved update process with clearer guidance
  - Added post-install message reminding developers to copy migrations
  - Added new `panda_cms:update:after_bundle` task to run after bundle update
  - Updated documentation with step-by-step update instructions

### Usage

After updating Panda CMS, run:

```shell
rails panda_cms:install:migrations
rails db:migrate
```

Or use the new automated task:

```shell
rails panda_cms:update:after_bundle
rails db:migrate
```
